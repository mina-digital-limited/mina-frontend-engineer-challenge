# Mina Frontend Engineer Challenge

If you've been asked to take this challenge, then we think you could have what it takes to join the engineering team at Mina.

The purpose of this challenge is to assess your coding and problem-solving skills.

## What to do

Mina predominantly uses [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/docs) throughout it's frontend ecosystem, utilising it's capabilities as a SPA with such features like a backend for frontend.

Using the nextjs repository as a base, we'd like you to create an application that:

- Accepts a GitHub username
- Displays information about the user on a different route, including a list of their public repositories
- Allow for the ability to click on the repositories, and navigate to a different route which displays the last 5 commits to that repo

We would like you to use:

- Typescript
- The Github REST API
- Next Routing
- NPM

## Things to note

- Implementation of styling (css) is unopinionated, use whatever you see fit
- If possible, use [api routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes)
- If possible, test the application at page and component level
- Browser support: modern browsers (i.e. no IE11)

## How to submit your code

- [Create a **private** mirror of this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository#mirroring-a-repository)
- Push your working solution to a branch on your repository
- Give [`elliotchaim`](https://github.com/elliotchaim) and [`humenko`](https://github.com/humenko) read access to your repository
- Create a pull request
  - Include any comments in the PR description. What would you change? Does anything feel 'off'? There are no wrong answers here!
  - Bonus points for a demo video in the PR
- Email your hiring manager with confirmation that your PR is ready for review
- Nobody does perfectly on challenges like this, and that's fine. We're not looking for perfection, we're looking to assess your approach to solving problems.

## Feedback

Weâ€™re always looking for ways we can improve our process, so please send us your thoughts. Thanks for taking the time to interview with us and good luck!
